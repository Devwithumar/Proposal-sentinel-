Automated Irrigation Optimization for Smallholder Farms

Smallholder farmers in the Sahel face water shortages. This project develops an automated irrigation
system combining low-cost sensors and weather-driven scheduling. We will survey farmers about practices
and incomes. The project will improve food security and reduce water use.

We will deploy pilot systems in three villages and evaluate adoption. Budget includes hardware, travel,
and miscellaneous costs.
